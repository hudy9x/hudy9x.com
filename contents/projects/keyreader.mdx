## A simple keystroke application for Windows

Initial, i was looking for a keystroke application for a few weeks. But nothing has a goood UI. By that time, I learned a new tool that helps Web developer to build a desktop application. 

So, I wondering why did i build my own keystroke app ?. And after a few months study I decided to start building it.

The UI inspired by KeyCasts - a beautiful keystroke application on MacOS. The idea was to watch user's typing actions and displays keystroke on the app.

This is an open-source application. Feel free to fork it to create your own version or contribute new features and bug fixes to my repository. I would love to learn from you all!
