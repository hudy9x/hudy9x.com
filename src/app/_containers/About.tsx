    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Initially, I started in web design, but the desire to bring my designs to life through code drew me to development. So, I learned to code and became a developer. In May, 2024 I shared a post on Dev.to about my open-source project and surprisingly itâ€™s going viral. This time I decided becoming an Indie Hacker.</p>
